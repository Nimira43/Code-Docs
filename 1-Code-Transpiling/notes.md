## Code Transpiling

###### Code transpiling in the browser, especially for JavaScript, is a fascinating process! Essentially, a transpiler converts modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond) into a version that older browsers can understand. This ensures your code works across different environments without needing to rewrite it from scratch.

###### For example, Babel is a popular transpiler that rewrites modern syntax like arrow functions and classes into equivalent ES5 code. This way, even if a user's browser doesn't support the latest features, they can still run your JavaScript smoothly.

## How does webpack help?

###### Webpack is a powerful tool that helps manage and optimise your JavaScript code for both development and production environments. Here’s how it helps with transpiling:

#### Bundling: 
###### Webpack takes all your JavaScript files and bundles them into a single file (or several files), which reduces the number of HTTP requests and speeds up your website.

#### Transpiling: 
###### It integrates seamlessly with tools like Babel to convert modern JavaScript (ES6+) into a version compatible with older browsers. This means you can write modern, clean code without worrying about browser compatibility.

#### Loaders and Plugins: 
###### Webpack uses loaders to preprocess files (like transpiling JavaScript) and plugins to perform a wide range of tasks, such as minifying code, optimising images, and more.

#### Development Features: 
###### It offers features like hot module replacement (HMR), which allows you to update modules in the browser without a full page reload, speeding up development.

###### In essence, Webpack streamlines the process of writing, bundling, and transpiling your JavaScript, making it easier to maintain and optimise your codebase.

## Distribution Folder

###### The dist (short for "distribution") folder is where your finalised code lives after being processed, bundled, and optimized. It's like your project’s ready-to-ship version, containing all the files you need for deployment, stripped of unnecessary elements like source maps and unused files. Essentially, it’s your project, polished and prepared for the world.
